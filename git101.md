# MacOS Git configuration and basic usage

## Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS.  It installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks them into /usr/local. 

The following commands should be run as your local user (not sudo'd to root) in your terminal

* `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

## Install git 
* `brew update`
* `brew install git`

## Global configuration
Configure your global settings:

* `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
* `git config --global user.email "<yourname@youremail.com>"`

## SSH Key Creation 
SSH Keys allow for secure communication when pushing or pulling code from a remote repository, such as github.com

  (only necessary if you don't already have a set of keys that you would like to use)

*  `$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`

## Add the new key to your github account

# Git Usage

## Generic git flow
1. Create the new repository from within the web interface
2. Clone the new repo to your local working directory
3. Create/Add your code inside the newly created repo directory
4. Be sure to add a README.md file to describe the contents/state the purpose of the repo
  1. [Basic markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
5. Don't wait to commit!  Each commit should be one minor update to the code, not an entire re-write
6. Branching should be used on code that has been published! (never push directly to master unless you are the only one working on the code, and even then, it's not recommended.)
  1. Create a new branch and name it after the specific fix or enhancement.
  2. make your updates to the branch.
  3. push the code and create a merge request
  4. peer review happens here
  5. depending on your workflow, either the peer will merge the code, or they will approve it so that you can merge it.


## Basic commands
* git status
* git diff
* git log
* git commit 
* git fetch
* git pull
* git push

## Create a new repository

* `git clone git@gitlab.vxrs.com:jkp/git101.git`
* `cd git101`
* `touch README.md`
* `git add README.md`
* `git commit -m "add README"`

## Push an existing folder
The remote repository must be created on the server first (via the web interface)

* `cd existing_folder`
* `git init`
* `git remote add origin git@gitlab.vxrs.com:jkp/git101.git`
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
* `git push -u origin master`

## Push an existing Git repository
The remote repository must be created on the server first (via the web interface)

* `cd existing_repo`
* `git remote rename origin old-origin`
* `git remote add origin git@gitlab.vxrs.com:jkp/git101.git`
* `git push -u origin --all`
* `git push -u origin --tags`
